title: The fear of my body

summary: I sit and think about the blood running through my veins, laying right beneath my skin. The heart that pumps that blood. Your bones, your brain, organs, intestines, stomach acid, and fat!

I sit and think about the blood running through my veins, laying right beneath my skin. The heart that pumps that blood. Your bones, your brain, organs, intestines, stomach acid, and fat! I think you get the point... but seriously *EWW*!  Itâ€™s a very uncomfortable feeling for me, I feel like I want to crawl out of my own body. Iâ€™m not freaked out about other people, or the human body in general. Iâ€™m just freaked out about my own, how can you run and hide from something that is literally your own physical being? This isnâ€™t a phobia that effects my daily life. But it is definitely a fear, and a disturbing thought for me.


*Body Dysmorphia*, now thatâ€™s a hard topic for meâ€¦ I hate the way my body is shaped, I hate my skin complexion, my hair,  and face. Everything from fat ankles to a big nose! I have a strong idea of beauty, and high standards. I will never be able to meet those standards. That makes me less of a person in my eyes.  Once again, I couldn't care less what anyone else looks like. I love peoples flaws and look for them often, peoples flaws interest me. Especially the flaws that I see in myself. Maybe in some weird way it makes me hate my physical self less? Or If that persons is still attractive, and socially accepted even with those flaws. Then maybe I could be too? 

And what does this all say about me? When I think of myself I think of my conscious mind, thoughts, and who I truly am stems from something you could never lay your eyes on. Iâ€™m thoughts ideas and emotions! Why does something have to be physical to be seen? I donâ€™t want to be seen, not even when looking in the mirror. ðŸªž
