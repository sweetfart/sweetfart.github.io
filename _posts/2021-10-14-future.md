Most of us start planning for a future at a young age. Whether it’s working hard to get good grades, looking forward to college or university with a suiting career in mind. You start dating with dreams of starting a happy family. Build your credit, with hopes of one day buying your dream house! But what if from a young age you couldn’t even see a tomorrow? The thought of living was too overwhelming to even think of. 

So of course a future was never given a second thought. Now you’re just existing.. making it through until tomorrow comes. No dream job, no house, no happy family, and no future… It never happened because you were busy surviving each day! Not thinking there would be a tomorrow… not wanting a tomorrow. Is it too late to want a future? 

Have I already wasted too much time?! Something you never wanted is now something you fear you can never have. Yes you have a future. No it isn’t too late.I am proud of myself and anyone that was brave enough to make it to tomorrow. Your future is tomorrow. And that’s good enough.
