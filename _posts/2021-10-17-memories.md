Memories decay and fade away. No matter how hard we try and hold on. They will leave us wondering, questioning and grasping for more detail. They will first start to morph, slowly losing all truth. 

But for some there are traumatic memories… these memories are engraved into our emotions. Most times we aren’t even aware of them. And if we are it’s very hard to find closure, or even validation. 

A certain sight, smell or sound can send those memories back to you. Flashing a mental image or emotion. A memory you did not chose or call upon. But now you're left remembering something you wish to forget. I can remember the worst moments of my life, in undoubtable detail. 

I beg my mind not to forget my happiness, my moments of pure joy. Yet they are slipping away. The memories that I need and want are now foggy and soon to be forgotten. 

**"*Short and sweet, a memory you can not keep*"**
